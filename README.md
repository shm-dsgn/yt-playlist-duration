OR

1. Download the ZIP file of the repository.
2. Extract the ZIP file.
3. Open Chrome or any Chromium based browser(eg: Brave or Microsoft Edge)
4. Go to `chrome://extensions` or Extension option in Settings 
5. Turn on **Developer Mode**.
6. Click on "Load Unpacked" and go into the folder where the ZIP file was extracted.

### Note (IMPORTANT)

1. Youtube by default doesn't load all the videos of a playlist if there are more than 50 videos. So to make the extension work properly, you need to scroll down to the end of the list so that all the videos are loaded.
